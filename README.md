# Shopify Tracker

Littledata's tracking script for Shopify stores.

## Shopify apps

This code is used by two Littledata apps:

-   [Google Analytics by Littledata](https://apps.shopify.com/littledata) ([source code](https://github.com/littledata/shopify-tracker/tree/master/src/gaTracker))

-   [Segment.com by Littedata](https://apps.shopify.com/segment-com-by-littledata) ([source code](https://github.com/littledata/shopify-tracker/tree/master/src/segmentTracker))

There is also an extra tracker for our [Carthook checkout connection](https://www.littledata.io/connections/carthook) ([source code](https://github.com/littledata/shopify-tracker/tree/master/src/cartHookTracker))

## Latest version

The latest minified versions of these scripts are hosted on a CDN:

-   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/littledata/shopify-tracker/dist/gaTracker.js

-   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/littledata/shopify-tracker/dist/segmentTracker.js

You can find which version your browser has loaded by looking at `LittledataScriptVersion` window-scope variable.

## Dependencies

These scripts rely on the `LittledataLayer` window-scope variable generated by a snippet in the Shopify store theme, and imported into the Store's active layout.

## Configuration

The following fields of the `LittledataLayer` object allow for configuration of tracking features:

**extraLinkerDomains**

To enable [cross-domain tracking](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033876?hl=en) on pages that your Shopify store **links to** (destination domains) you can add an extra array of domains to the data layer. You **do not** need to add domains here which only send traffic to your Shopify store (source domains) - by default this script will look for the linker URL parameters.

You will also need to [enable the Google Analytics linker](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/cross-domain) on those source or destination domains.

Example: `['mylandingpage.com']` (array)

**googleAdsConversionIds**

Add the Google Ads (AdWords) conversion IDs that you [configured with Ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9266898). This accepts an array of strings. Our script will automatically add this to `gtag('config')` command.

Example: `['AW-11111111', 'AW-22222222']` (array)

**optimizeId**

This is where to add the Google Optimize container ID that you want to [configure with gtag](https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7513085). Our script will automatically add this to `gtag('config')` command.

Example: `GTM-123ABC` (string)

**anonymizeIp**

This field to instructs the gtag library to [mask the last 3 numbers of the user's IP address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052), to support greater user privacy at the expense of some geo-location accuracy.

Default: `true` (boolean)

**googleSignals**

This field opts your site into using [Google Signals](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985?hl=en), to enable more powerful demographic reports and cross-device tracking using the Google Ads cookie. You need to check this is compatible with your website terms of use.

Default: `true` (boolean)

**productClicks**

By default our tracking code briefly interrupts a click on a product in a product list, in order to send the tracking event before the page reloads. If this is interfering with other apps or scripts you can turn off product list click tracking.

Default: `true`

**productPageClicks**

By default we track clicks on product images and social share buttons on the product details page. If this doesn't work with your theme you can opt out by setting this field to `false`.

Default: `null`

**persistentUserId**

To enable tracking of users across a longer time period of Safari we store the cookie user ID [in the browser local storage](https://blog.littledata.io/2019/05/24/how-to-fix-marketing-attribution-for-safari-itp-2-1/). Since there is no way to clear this local storage when the user deletes their cookies, you may need to check that this is consistent with your privacy policy.

Default: `true` (boolean)

**hideBranding**

Our app generates a branded message in the site console log. You can disable this.

Default: `false` (boolean)

**doNotTrackReplaceState**

For some themes, where the URL changes (e.g. a new variant) without a new page load our script will track a new page view. Change this setting to `true` to disable a new page view on `history.replaceState()` via [browser History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)

Default: `undefined` (boolean)

**cookiesToTrack** _(Segment only)_

Grab the values from an array of named cookies and pass them as traits on Segment identify calls.

Example: `['iterableEmailCampaignId]` (array)

**MPEndpoint**

If you wish to direct the Measurement Protocol hits to a custom collection endpoint of your choosing, add it here. **NOTE**: this will block the sending of hits to Google Analytics.

Example: `https://collector.littledata.io/collect` (string)
